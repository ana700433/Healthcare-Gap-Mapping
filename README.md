# Healthcare Gap Mapping

**Tools:** Power BI | Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) | Excel

## Objective
Analyze and visualize disparities in mental-health provider availability across rural U.S. regions.

## Methodology
1. Collected and cleaned public datasets (CDC, WHO, and state-level health data).
2. Processed data using Python for population-provider ratios by county.
3. Built Power BI maps with color-coded shortage indicators.
4. Created summary dashboards showing regional gaps and priority areas.

## Key Insights
- 35% of rural counties had fewer than 1 provider per 10,000 residents.
- Midwest and Southern states displayed the highest concentration of underserved areas.

## Impact
Delivered a data-driven framework to support healthcare resource allocation and telemedicine expansion.
